Testing
-------------------

The Enhanced Sampling Toolkit uses the 
`pytest module <http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ to perform unit tests on module provided in the toolkit. To run the provided test suite, navigate to the test subdirectory and run 

.. code:: Bash

    py.test

from the command line. Add the filename as an argument to py.test to run a specific module's tests.
