HOW TO RUN WITH LAMMPS
Files required in the "data" directory:

1) A data file containing the LAMMPS system and force field definition.

2) A computes file that defines the LAMMPS computes used to report
the collective variables. 

To be implemented in the future:

A system for defining the structure of the basis functions and partitioning
from an input file. This could be modeled after the colvars language used in 
NAMD and LAMMPS. 

OTHER TYPES OF SIMULATIONS
A single file is required, which contains the method.
	getWalker()	This returns an instance of a walker object, as specified in walker.py.
