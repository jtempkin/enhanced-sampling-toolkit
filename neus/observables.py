"""
This module contains a list of observable routines. These functions serve to calculation and record the value of observables in the course of a calculation.

These routines are initialized as their own class and subsequently can be invoked during other calculations or called by other routines. We may consider updating these classes with a base class prototype similar to how the walker class was initialized.
