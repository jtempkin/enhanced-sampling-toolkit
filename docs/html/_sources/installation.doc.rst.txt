Installation
=================

To install the Enhanced Sampling Toolkit on your local machine, download the package from the `Github page <https://github.com/jtempkin/enhanced_sampling_toolkit>`_.

To install the toolkit, run

.. code:: python

    python setup.py install

from the root of the toolkit package. If you plan on developing the files in the toolkit, use

.. code:: python

    python setup.py develop

which will use the state of the local files. Note that this will allow changes made locally to the package files to visible in your Python environment.
